T1_IR: measuring T1 via the inversion recovery (180-90) sequence. The scope is set up to show the FID after the 90 deg pulse. The number after the underscore in each file indicates the delay time between the two pulses in ms.

T1_SR: measuring T1 via the inversion recovery (90-90) sequence. The scope is set up to show the FID after the second 90 deg pulse. The number after the underscore in each file indicates the delay time between the two pulses in ms.

T2_SE: measuring T2 via the spin echo (90-180) sequence. The scope is set up to show both the 180 deg pulse and the spin echo. The number after the underscore in each file indicates the delay time between the two pulses (not between the first pulse and the echo!) in ms.

CP: measuring T2 via the Carr-Purcell (90-180-180-180-...) sequence. The scope is set up to show the entire sequence with the 90 deg pulse at t = 0.

MG: measuring T2 via the Meiboom-Gill (CP + phase shift) sequence. The scope is set up to show the entire sequence with the 90 deg pulse at t = 0.
